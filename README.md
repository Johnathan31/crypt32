## 🔐 Overview

**crypt32** is a custom substitution-based cipher focused on producing highly unpredictable output.  
It is *not* designed to replace modern cryptography, but rather to serve as:

- A practical cryptography exercise  
- A lightweight cipher for creative or non-sensitive applications  
- A demonstration of unpredictable substitutions and salt-based variation  

The cipher includes built-in *salt generation* which increases the complexity and makes outputs harder to guess or pattern-match.

> ⚠️ **Security Warning**  
> This library is **not a modern secure cipher** and should **not** be used to protect confidential or critical data.
